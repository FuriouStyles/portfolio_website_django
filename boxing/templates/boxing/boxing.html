  <h1>Boxing Match Outcome Predictor</h1>
  <h3>404 - A more satisfying name does not exist!</h3>
  <p>I love boxing. The first time I put gloves on I was 13 years old at summer camp. I won in around 20 seconds by TKO and was immediately hooked. As an active amateur boxer considering a professional career in the sport, I want to transform the way I engage with the sweet science by using data science.</p>
